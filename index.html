      <h1>Python Introduction </h1>
      <h2>General Summary </h2>
      <h4> History of Python </h4>
	  <p>Python was made by Guido can Rossum in 1989 at CWI! No, not that CWI. Cebtrum Wiskunde and Informatica, in Amsterdam. Guido built the language, inspired by languages like Java, Lisp, Perl, Haskell and C, to try to create something just as powerful and useable, while also making it as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as possible. Bringing powerful languages down to a level where a less skilled programmer can still wield all the power a language like C++ or Java can have, without all the annoying intricacies or weird formatting to hinder them.</p>
	  <p>The language is known for being a bit of a one-size-fits-all language, useable in a lot of different programming situations. Scripting, programming, machine learning, graphics processing, and all kinds of other things. However, instead of making the language with all this functionality out-of-the-box, Guido decided to instead focus on making Python an incredibly extensible language. Combined with it's focus on ease of use, as well as readability, it makes Python one of the most popular and most versatile language in the world.</p>
	  <p>According to 'Zen of Python', written by Tim Peters, Python has many key guiding principles:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
		  <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
		  <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
		  <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
		  <li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
		  <li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
		  <li><b>Readability counts.</b></li>
		  <li>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</li>
		  <li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
		  <li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
		  <li>Unless explicitly silenced.</li>
		  <li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
		  <li>There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.</li>
		  <li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li>
		  <li>Now is better than never.</li>
		  <li>Although never is often better than right now.</li>
		  <li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
		  <li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
		  <li>Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!</li>
		  <li>Use proper indentation or I'll break your kneecaps.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>(...Ok, maybe not that last one.)</p>
	  <p>So, while it's not the most technically powerful language in the world, it's extensibility combined with it's user-friendly nature makes it one of the most effective languages in the world.</p>

      <h4>Where Python is used today</h4>
	  <p>Have you ever used Wikipedia? How about Google? Facebook? Spotify? Reddit? Well, congratulations, all of those sites use python in their websites. In fact, Reddit is implemented in Python entirely! It's versatility makes it a natural choice for most websites.</p>
	  <p>Python is included in standard operating system MacOS, as well as almost every distribution of Linux.</p>
	  <p>Python is even used by NASA! Meeting the United Space Alliance's requirements of a language being 'fast, cheap and light', Python is used by NASA today to do secret-NASA things. They don't tell anyone <i>exactly</i> what they're doing with it, but they're NASA, so that makes sense.</p>
	  <p>The Raspberry Pi (a computer about the size of a wallet, costing less than $40) has the word 'Pi' in it's name not only as a clever play on words, but as a reference to Python! Python is a primary language used on the Pi, and a majority of the systems on it are built and optimized for Python programs and programming.</p>
	  <p>Python has even gone on to inspire many other languages, such as Groovy, a language built to make Java more Python-like. Other inspired languages include Cobra, CoffeeScript, Go, Swift, and many others. Specifically, those languages usually follow in Python's footsteps in terms of syntax, indentation style, and ease-of-use.</p>
    <h4> Python's programming paradigms </h4>
    <p> Python supports four main programming paradigms: imperative, functional, procedural, and object oriented. This page will only be highlighting the object oriented and procedural paradigms.
	  <h3>Object oriented Python</h3>
	  <p>Python is used as an object-oriented language (OOL). Object-oriented programming is a unique and difficult concept, but to put it simply: it acts on the idea that everything in a given program is an 'object', with properties and functions that can be the same as other objects, but act independently. It saves on resource usage, while also making the program much easier to manage. In an OOL, if you want there to be two different cars in your program, you just call two Cars(), and differentiate them. In a non-OOL, however, you have to create the codebase and the programming for each car independently, which takes more time, disk space, and resource usage when running the program. This is a simple explanation, of course.</p>

	  <h3>Procedural Python</h3>
	  <p>Python is commonly used as a procedural programming language in scripting environments. This paradigm is a subset of imperative programming in which statements are structured into procedures. This paradigm is typically a list of instructions that execute one after the other starting from the top of the first line of the program. This is useful for creating modules that can be unrelated to other modules and programs yet still be accessed by said programs and work together with other modules to achieve goals for the program. As well as support reuse of procedures within a program that are defined in either other libraries or modules.</p>


      <!-- <h4>Short explanation of how python is a object-oriented language (Maybe scripting language as well)</h4> -->
      <h4>Quirks and advantages</h4>
	  <p>No language is perfect, but every language has it's specialties, and Python is no exception. What some would consider downsides, other consider features. Here's a few examples of how Python is a bit different than other, similar languages:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>It's extreme <b>Popularity</b> makes it a bit of a token choice at times, but also makes it compatible with countless codebases and modules people have made in the past</li>
		<li>It's fundamentally <b>Object-Oriented</b> nature makes it useable in modern object-oriented programming styles, and especially powerful when dealing with large amounts of objects or data.</li>
		<li>Python features <b>Automatic Garbage-Collection</b>, making it easy for people to toss large amounts of data around without having to worry about data leaks.</li>
		<li>It's <b>Ease-of-Use</b> as well as it's relatively <b>Forgiving Learning Curve</b> makes it ideal for beginning programmers, or those learning the language for a project.</li>
		<li>It's <b>Expansive Standard Library</b> makes it incredibly powerful even without any expansions, making it incredibly useful out-of-the-box.</li>
		<li>Python is an <b>Indentation/Whitespace Sensitive</b> language, meaning the indentation style is important and fundamental to how it's written. Many people don't like this, but it removes the need for many formatting items such as brackets ((){}[]) in certain scenarios.</li>
	  </ul>

      <h2>Python Fundamentals</h2>
      <h4>How to start IDLE</h4>
		<p>IDLE is Python's own little development interface, which comes with the installation of Python. Basically, it's where you type the code to make the code work. While other IDEs are useable, we'll be sticking with this one for now. Instructions on how to install IDLE (and Python as a whole) are in the 'installation' section.</p>
		<p>After installing IDLE/Python, IDLE should be available as an application. Running that will open a menu that looks a little like this:</p>
		<code>Python 3.9.0 (tags/v3.9.0:9cf6752, Jan  1 2048, 42:00:69) [MSC v.1927 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32</code> <br>
		<code>Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.</code> <br>
		<code>>>></code> <br>
		<p>If you see this, don't panic, you're exactly in the right spot. This is called the 'Python Shell'</p>
		<p>Typing code into here will run it. For example, type this:</p>
		<code>asdf = 12</code>
		<p>Then press enter. After that, type</p>
		<code>print(asdf)</code>
		<p>And press enter. Underneath what you just typed, the number 12 should appear. While you may not know why yet, just know that IDLE is working properly.</p>
		<p>BUT: what if you want to make programs?</p>
		<p>To make a new program, head to 'file' and hit 'New File'. This will let you make your own Python programs which will run in the Python Shell.</p>
      <h4>What you need for a program to run.</h4>
		<p>Once you have a new file open to start making code, make some code!</p>
		<p>Let's start with something simple. Type the following:</p>
		<code>myCoolInteger = 8675309</code><br>
		<code>myCoolString = "cool"</code><br>
		<code></code><br>
		<code>print(myCoolInteger,"is",myCoolString)</code><br>
		<p>Once you have your program all typed up, hit 'File', then 'Save', and store it somewhere.</p>
		<p>To run your cool new program, hit 'Run', then 'Run Module'. The Python Shell will run your brand new code in it.</p>
      <h4>Syntax (needs expanded on but we need to consider what is to be documented here or in our examples)</h4>
		<p>Python's written syntax is relatively simple, with one key thing that many languages do not have: <b>significant indentation!</b></p>
		<p>While good indentation in other programs is recommended for readability, in Python it's also important for the compiler to read it too. Where you put your tabs and why is very important. For example, everything contained in a 'while' loop or an 'if' statement must be indented within it, or else it assumes it not to be part of that loop.</p>
		<code>x = 2</code><br>
		<code>if x==2:</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    print("I'm in the if!")</code><br>
		<code>print("I'm not in the if!")</code><br>
		<p>Or:</p>
		
		<code>while x &#60; 5:</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">print("I will print 5 times!")</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">x = x + 1</code><br>
		<code>print("I will print once!")</code><br>
		
		
		<p>Aside from that, Python syntax is pretty straight-forward. Creating a variable is done with [name] = [value], such as: </p>
		<code>HowOldAmI = 22</code>
		<p>And Python is built to understand what variable type it should be! In this instance, HowOldAmI would be an integer, with the data '22' stored inside it.</p>
		<p>Comments are easy too! Just use the # character to leave a comment, and the computer will ignore whatever you throw in there.</p>
		<code>while x &#60; 5: #I am the ghost of development past!</code><br>
      <h4> Common built in data structures</h4>
	  <p>There's a boatload of ways to store a pile of data. Unordered? Ordered? Changeable? It seems there's a data type to support whatever you need. We'll start with these four:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Lists</li>
		  <li>Sets</li>
		  <li>Tuples</li>
		  <li>Dictionaries</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  	<table style="border-color: Black">
		  <tr>
			<th>Type:</th>
			<th>Ordered?</th>
			<th>Indexed?</th>
			<th>Changeable?</th>
			<th>Annoying?</th>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>List</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>No</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Tuple</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>Kinda</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Set</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>No</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Dictionary</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes...</td>
		  </tr>
		</table>
	  
		<p>Here are some examples of how to instatiate and access each elements for these four data structures:</p>
		<h5> List</h5>
		<code>l = [1,2,"a"]</code><br>
		<code>l[0]</code><br>
		<p>output: 1</p>
		<h5> Tuple</h5>
		<code>t = (1,2,"a")</code><br>
		<code>t2 = 1,2,"a"</code><br>
		<p>Note: tuples can be created by comma seperated values</p>
		<code>t[0]</code>
		<p>output: 1</p>
		<h5>Set</h5>
		<code> A = {1,2,3,4}</code><br>
		<code> B = set(3,4,5,6)</code><br>
		<code> A.intersection(B)</code><br>
		<p>output: 3,4</p>
		<h5>Dictionary</h5>
		<code>d = {'first':'string value', 'second':[1,2,"a"]}</code><br>
		<code>d['first']</code><br>
		<code>d.get('second')</code>
		<p>output:'string value'</p>
		<p>output:[1,2,"a"]</p>
      <h4> Control flow statements</h4>
	  <p>When does the code learn what code to run next?</p>
	  <h5>IF</h5>
	  <p>Good ol' IF.</p>
	  <p>Syntax:</p>
	  <code>x = 2</code><br>
		<code>if x==2:</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    print("I'm in the if!")</code><br>
	  <p>IF is used to check a conditional statement to know whether or not to run a set of code. It checks to see if a particular thing is true or not, and if it is, it runs whatever is indented in front of it.</p>
	  <p>May contain an optional 'else' statement, which is a set of code to run instead if the conditional isn't true.</p>
	  <h5>FOR</h5>
	  <p>FOR is a bit more complex. FOR [things] IN [list]: [do stuff to things]</p>
	  <p>It runs over the same code over and over again for a list of items in an array.</p>
	  <p>Syntax:</p>
	  <code>for x in range(1,8):</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    print(x, "bottles of beer on the wall")</code><br>
	  <p>May contain an optional 'else' statement, which runs when the FOR loop finishes.</p>
	  <h5>WHILE</h5>
	  <p>The WHILE is like an IF if it got stuck, like a record player. It keeps doing that little bit of code, over and over again, as long as it's conditional is still true.</p>
	  <p>Syntax:</p>
	  <code>x = 2</code><br>
		<code>while x &#60; 8:</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    print("I'm in the while!")</code><br>
		<code style="margin-left: 40px">    x = x + 1</code><br>
	  <p>May contain an optional 'else' statement, which runs when the WHILE loop finishes.</p>
      <h4> Functions</h4>
	  <p>A function is a method, essensially. When a certain keyword() is called, it does some code. To define a function, use 'def'</p>
	  <code>def do_the_thing():</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 40px">    print("I'm doing the thing!")</code><br>
	  <code>do_the_thing()</code><br>
	  <p>And to call, simply use <code>do_the_thing()</code>.</p>
	  <p>Arguments can be added as well, which are variables you can pass into a function to make it do stuff! simply put something in the brackets (()) when you define it, and something in the brackets when you call it, and it will pass that data from the call to the variable you define in the def function.</p>
	  <code>def do_the_thing(thing):</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 40px">    print("I'm doing the", thing, "!")</code><br>
	  <code>def do_the_thing_2(too, thing):</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 40px">    print("I'm doing the", thing, too, "!")</code><br>
	  <code>do_the_thing_2("too", "thing")</code><br>
	  <p>You can even have a function take an unknown number of variables by using the * symbol like this: <code>do_something_else(*stuff)</code></p>
	  <p>Functions can be called within other functions, with different data, to make big, complex programs! Also, there's many other ways to format the input paramaters and output of a function. You can make it take a dictionary, you can make it have default values, you can use the <code>return</code> keyword to have it return a value when called, and you can use the <code>pass</code> keyword to have a function do... nothing.</p>
      <h4> Object oriented programming </h4>
	  <p>Object-oriented programming is the idea that code is composed of many different types of classes and objects, which all have inherint and inherited code from it's parent class, to save on data and space. In an object oriented language, if you want there to be two different cars in your program, you just call two Cars(), and differentiate them. In a non-object oriented language, however, you have to create the codebase and the programming for each car independantly, which takes more time, disk space, and resource useage when running the program.</p>
	  <p>A 'class' is a blueprint with which to create objects. For instance, if I wanna make the 'car' class, I simply do this:</p>
	  <code>class Car:</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 40px">pass</code><br>
	  <p>And if I want things to be added to that car when I create a car, I define the __init__ function: </p>
	  <code>class Car:</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 40px">def __init__(self, color, model):</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 80px">self.color = color</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 80px">self.model = model</code><br>
	  <p>With that class, I can create a new car object by saying <code>x = Car("blue", "Mitsibishi")</code></p>
	  <p>We can define functions in that class to act on the paramaters inside it. For example:</p>
	  <code>class Car:</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 40px">def __init__(self, color, model):</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 80px">self.color = color</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 80px">self.model = model</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 40px">def printColor():</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 80px">print(color)</code><br>
	  <p>...Then we can call it with:</p>
	  <code>x = Car("blue", "Mitsibishi")</code><br>
	  <code>x.printColor();</code><br>
	  <p>And we can even make smaller child classes from existing classes! Simply put the parent class in the parentheses and voila! Child class. Example:</p>
	  <code>class Sportscar(Car):</code><br>
	  <code style="margin-left: 40px">pass</code><br>
	  <p>...And that child class can have it's own paramaters and functions.</p>
	  <h4> Procedural programming</h4>
	  <p> As stated earlier python supports the paradigm of Procedural programming which relies on procedure calls to modularize code and help simplify a program by by breaking code into smaller pieces that can later be called and used collectevly by a developer.
	      Procedural programming is an older form of application development but is still very useful for solutions that lend themselves to step-by-step execution.</p>
	      <p>Python supports this very much so in scripting environments such as Jupyter Notebook or Cocalc of which written and module procedures are commonly all that is used in a program.</p>
	      <p>A simple example of this programming paradigm would be as follows:</p>
	      <code>x = [1,2,3,4,5]</code><br>
	      <code>def average(list):</code><br>
	      <code style="margin-left: 40px">tmp = 0</code><br>
	      <code style="margin-left: 40px">for i in list:</code><br>
	      <code style="margin-left: 80px">tmp = i + tmp</code><br>
	      <code style="margin-left: 40px">return tmp/len(x)</code><br>
	      <code>print(average(x))</code>
      <h4> Variable scope and lifetime </h4>
	  <p>Python has three levels of scope (or four, depending on who you ask), though usually people think of it as two. Global and non-global. However, let's look at all three individually:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Local/Enclosing (shortest)</li>
		  <li>Global</li>
		  <li>Built-in (longest)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h5>Local/Enclosing</h5>
	  <p>The shortest and fastest of the four. If a variable is defined in a function, it only exists within the function, and is destroyed (or at least becomes unreachable until it's garbage-collected) once the function ends.</p>
	  <p>Since it's the shortest and cheapest scope, you wanna try to make as many of your variables you can manage in this scope. Cluttering memory with variables you only need once can be avoided by using local scope.</p>
	  <p>Similarly, if there is a function <i>within</i> another function, all the variables in that inner function are enclosed within that inner function, and cannot be accessed directly by the surrounding function that it's in. If you have an outer() and an inner() function, inner() can access variables in outer(), but outer() can't access variables in inner()</p>
	  <h5>Global</h5>
	  <p>Global variables can be seen, accessed, and changed anywhere in the program. If you've got a thing that's too important and too integral to the program to pass between function paramaters, make it global. Make it big and loud enough that the rest of the program can just know what it is and where it is.</p>
	  <p>Global variables are either declared outside of a function, or by using the <code>global</code> keyword when defining it within a function. While this can be tricky, as you don't want to accidentally call on a global variable that hasn't been declared yet, it can be useful in a pinch when you gotta make a new variable that the whole program can see.</p>
	  <h5>Built-in</h5>
	  <p>Essensially, this is the scope that all Python keywords fall under, and everything in there has already been defined for you.</p>
	  <p>You don't wanna have to go through with every program and define what things like <code>True</code> and <code>while</code> mean, so this scope is where all of those are sitting. If you're messing with this scope, you'd better know what you're doing.</p>
	  <h5>LEGB Rule?</h5>
	  <p>The LEGB is the idea that if you tell Python to find the x variable, it will first look in the Local scope, then the Enclosing scope (in any function that this function may be nested in), then in the Global scope, then finally in the Built-in scope, in that order. If it finds it in one of those scopes, it will use whatever it found first. If it doesn't find it, it will catch your computer on fire. I'm kidding, of course, it will actually just throw an error and kill your program.</p>
	  <p>In general, you want your variables to be as far up (towards local) in that order as you can, to save on resource space in your program.</p>
